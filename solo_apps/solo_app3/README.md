# solo_app3


For solo app 3, I made a simple app to generate images of a random dog breed using the Dog CEO API.
https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random will give an image of a random dog breed each time it is 
searched/ran along with a status of the request. Dogs are stored in a list where the user can 
navigate through their session history. 

The app is contained completely from the main.dart file and can be run from void main()

Users can load new dogs by pulling down on the screen and using the RefreshIndicator() widget
or they may press the New Dog button to execute the same action. Additional user actions include
navigating through their session of dogs using the Previous and Next buttons. 

An error is forced on the 5th dog and a refresh option is given to clear the error and continue
sending requests to the API and running the app
